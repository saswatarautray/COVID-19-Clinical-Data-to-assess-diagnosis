# COVID-19-Clinical-Data-to-assess-diagnosis

COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, overwhelming healthcare systems - unprepared for such intense and lengthy request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protection equipment and healthcare resources. Brazil recorded first COVID-19 case on February 26 and reached community transmission on March 20


### Goal
Predict admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Based on the data available, is it feasible to predict which patients will need intensive care unit support? The aim is to provide tertiary and quarternary hospitals with the most accurate answer, so ICU resources can be arranged or patient transfer can be scheduled.

We will seek a solution that can, segregate patients who MUST in the ICU, in terms of measures, we will look at Precision-Recall.


I explored RandomForest classifier, Gradient boosting classifiers in this project.
